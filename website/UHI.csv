Green Roofs and Walls (ENEA Study),Green Roofs,Reduced urban air temperature by over 1°C in summer; 0.33°C average reduction in Rome and 0.5°C in Turin. Peaks of 1.17°C reduction in Rome.,1,"Simulation of 12,000 m² green roofs and 60,000 m² green walls in Rome; 6,000 m² living walls in Turin. Effectiveness depends on urban geometry, building height, and plant species.",Italy,https://www.media.enea.it/en/press-releases-and-news/years-archive/year-2023/environment-green-roofs-and-walls-cool-by-over-1-c-urban-temperatures-in-summer.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com

Cool Roofs and Cool Pavements Toolkit,Cool Roofs & Pavement,Reduced temperature in Los Angeles by 2–3K; air pollution equivalent to removing all vehicle exhaust.,2.5,Resurfacing two-thirds of pavements and rooftops with reflective materials; planting three trees per house. Provides cooling energy savings of $100 per air-conditioned home annually.,USA,https://coolrooftoolkit.org/knowledgebase/energy-saving-potentials-and-air-quality-benefits-of-urban-heat-island-mitigation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com
Cooling Potential of Green Roofs (Jamei et al.),Green Roofs 2,Cooling effect of green roofs ranges from 1°C (hot-humid climates) to 3°C (dry climates). Surface temperature reduction of 30°C in hot-humid cities.,2,Review of 89 studies from 2000–2020 across various climate types. Highlights the dependency on climatic conditions and the underexplored impact in dry climates.,Misc.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34412394/
White Roofs Study,White Roofs,Could have reduced heat deaths by a third in the 2003 European heatwave. Reduces temperatures in heatwave conditions.,1,Retrospective study analyzing white roofs' reflective cooling effect.,UK,https://www.thetimes.com/uk/environment/article/white-roofs-could-have-cut-heat-deaths-by-a-third-h33w9df6m?utm_source=chatgpt.com&region=global
Cool Roofs and Heat-Related Mortality in the West Midlands,Cool Roofs & Pavement,"Reduced city center daytime 2m air temperature by 0.5°C on average during heatwaves; up to 3°C reduction at peak daytime temperatures.Reduced UHI intensity by ~23%, offsetting 18% of seasonal UHI-related heat-related mortality (7% of total heat-related mortality).  Modifying half of all industrial/commercial buildings had the same impact as modifying all high-intensity residential buildings.",2,Regional weather model assessed cool roofs' impact on UHI during summer and heatwaves in 2006 and 2003.,UK,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30959308/
